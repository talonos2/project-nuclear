		#day2
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: I'm trying to prep for the injuries Douglass will have when he comes back.  Did you see what that last gooey thing did to him?  I kinda closed my eyes...
		@exit


		#day3
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Don't get me wrong, as a doctor I have to deal with all kinds of, um... goo, but those slimes give me the willies.
		@exit
		

		#day4
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Maybe I can still help.  Every living thing has to have some weakness after all.
		Fluer: But does a slime even have a hamstring?
		@exit
		

		#day5
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: It makes me wish I'd had more practice.[br]People are just too healthy around here.
		@exit

		
		#day6
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: I can't take much credit.  I barely had a chance to diagnose him before he recovered.
		@exit

		
		#day7
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Using a no-clip hack, seriously?
		@exit
		

		#day8
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Most of those creatures seem to be biologically impossible... there must be some other key to their weaknesses.
		@exit

		
		#day9
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Maybe if we could disrupt the magic that is keeping them alive.
		Fluer: Or overload it!
		@exit

		
		#day10
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: I...  I can't do anything if nobody comes back.
		@exit

		
		#day11
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Usually monsters don't last so long in the wild.  They're too aggressive...[br]You would think being cooped up in a cave would accelerate that.
		@exit

		
		#day12
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Lets see, the heart would be riiiight here.
		@exit
		

		#day13
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: The thing that bothers me is that the slimey things don't seem to have more than one skeloton worth of bones in them...
		@exit
		

		#day14
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Come to think of it...  When was the last time any of us got sick?
		@exit

		
		#day15
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: If you see any bread laying around please leave it where it is.
		Fluer: It's for science.

		#day17
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Hrrrmmm...
		Fluer: The bread.  It's not as moldy over here.
		@exit

		
		#day18
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: Which one is killing us?[br]The plague or the cure?
		@exit

		
		#day19
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: They seemed to get sicker, and a then didn't... and then did.
		@exit

		
		#day20
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: What if the altar is preventing disease?<br>But how could it keep that up all this time?
		@exit

		
		#day21
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: It's just safer here...[br] and healthier...
		@exit

		
		#day22
		@char Fluer
		Fluer: If there's a sickness, you keep people out.[br]It's the responsible thing to do...

		#getIce
		@char Fluer
		Oooh, I can feel my humors going out of balance.
		@exit

		#getEarth
		@char Fluer
		Definitely feeling more melancholic, but I have to go on!
		@exit

		#getFire
		@char Fluer
		Whew, starting to feel choleric.
		@exit

		#getAir
		@char Fluer
		There!  My humors are finally in balance again!
