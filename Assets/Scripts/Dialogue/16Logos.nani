		There isn't much to see right now.  Without someone to follow I can't see beyond the entrance.

		#day3
		@char Logos
		The spell is difficult to maintain, but I will endure.
		@stop
		

		#day4
		@char Logos
		I almost saw something at the end that time...
		@stop
		

		#day5
		@char Logos
		The curse strikes with no regard for persons...
		@stop

		
		#day6
		@char Logos
		If I disappear who will maintain the view?
		@stop

		
		#day7
		@char Tedd
		I can do this.  I know I can!
		@char Logos
		It is not enough to believe in magic, one must have focus as well.
		@stop
		

		#day8
		@char Logos
		Perhaps you aren't thinking about this the right way...
		@Jinn
		Let me draw a chart of what I'm trying to do...
		@stop

		
		#day9
		@char Logos
		Perhaps... you could ask her to help?
		@stop

		
		#day10
		@char Logos
		Sigh... I don't suppose you've had any spark of seership? Strange dreams maybe?
		@stop

		
		#day11
		@char Logos
		Perhaps... I can just keep this going as long as I can.
		@stop

		
		#day12
		@char Logos
		So, when you look into the glass, what do you see?
		@char Jezerine
		I just see myself.
		@char Logos
		Well, it was worth a try.
		@stop
		
		#atDoor
		@char Logos
		This (scrying thing) isn't even reflective...
		@stop

		#day13
		@char Tristana
		You have to admit, this would be a great way to do investigative reporting.
		@char Logos
		In other times your lack of far-sight might be a relief.
		@stop
		

		#day14
		@char Elder
		I see myself wandering the town, but everything looks... simpler.
		@char Logos
		Lets... lets just not worry about that too much.
		@stop

		
		#day15
		@char Logos
		I'm afraid we aren't getting anywhere.
		@char Patrick
		But I have to try something!
		@stop

		
		#day16
		@char Fluer
		Your appendix looks like it'll have to come out in a few years.  But hey, your kidneys are looking pretty good!
		@char Logos
		This is... useful, but not so much right now.
		@stop

		


		#getIce
		@char Logos
		Magic? But not like any I have seen...
		@stop

		#getEarth
		@char Logos
		I am not so accustomed to brutish force, but I will make due.
		@stop

		#getFire
		@char Logos
		I studied the magic arts for years, but it looks like all I had to do was defeat the right monster.
		@stop

		#getAir
		@char Logos
		Four spells, if only I had time to study them.
		@stop
